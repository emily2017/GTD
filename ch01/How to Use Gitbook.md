# Basics
##What is GitBook?

GitBook is both an online platform for writing and hosting documentation, and an open source book format and toolchain.

Hundreds of thousands of users use GitBook to write documentation (library, API, tools, etc.), or knowledge bases (like this F.A.Q.). People also use GitBook to publish technical books, teaching material, and many other things.

## Who's using GitBook?
GitBook is used by more than 100,000 users worldwide, including software engineers, teachers, students and even governments.

GitBook is also used by companies (DuckDuckGo), organizations (Django Girls) and open-source projects (Redux).

## Can I use GitBook to publish an F.A.Q. like this one?
You can create an F.A.Q. with GitBook. As a matter of fact, this Help Center is made with GitBook and hosted on GitBook.com.

To create an F.A.Q., you can install and use the theme-faq. Soon, you will be able to choose a F.A.Q. template from the book creation page on GitBook.com.

## How can I change the theme?
Since GitBook's v3 release, the entire theme can be changed and customized. Installing a theme is just like installing a plugin.

Themes work by extending the HTML templates and CSS of the default book. If you are interested in tweaking a theme, or making your own, more infos is available in the documentation.

Examples of themes

# ACCOUNTS & BILLING
## What plan should I choose?

## Why am I getting an error "An account with this email address already exists"?

Log out from the account associated with your email

##How can I allow comments on my book?
In the settings page of your book, you can enable or disable discussions. People who have a read access to your book will be able to start discussions on your book from the discussions tab of your book's dashboard.
If you allowed discussions, you can also allow inline comments in the settings of your book. If you just enabled this feature, it will only be effective the next time you update the content of your book. Then the website for your book will display a "+" button near paragraphs for people to start discussions from there.

This feature can be enabled on your book settings, under the "Features" section:
